# OAT Audit
Open Accessibility Testing (OAT) Audit is a web application to help you keep track of manual accessibility audits.

## Why?
I realized there weren't any free open-source tools to track manual accessibility auditing. I created an [accessibility testing checklist](http://checklist.garcialo.com) and then eventually a Google Sheets-based [auditing spreadsheet](http://audit.garcialo.com) to help me keep track of manual audits.

This project is essentially rebuilding the auditing spreadsheet without relying on Google Sheets.

## Goals
* Remain free and open source
* Have at least one regular user other than myself

## Using
* Eleventy (11ty) static site generator
* Dexie.js a minimalistic wrapper for IndexedDB
