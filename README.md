# OAT Audit
Open Accessibility Testing (OAT) Audit is a web application that helps track manual accessibility audits.

## Why?
Realized there weren't any free open-source tools to track manual accessibility auditing. I created an [accessibility testing checklist (http://checklist.garcialo.com)](http://checklist.garcialo.com) as a first step towards creating a Google Sheets-based [auditing spreadsheet (http://audit.garcialo.com)](http://audit.garcialo.com) to help me track audits.

This project strives to recreate and eventually improve upon the auditing spreadsheet as a web app.

## Goals
* Remain accessible, free, and open source
* Have at least one regular user other than myself

## Using
* [Eleventy (https://www.11ty.dev/)](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator
* [Dexie.js (https://dexie.org/)](https://dexie.org/) a minimalistic wrapper for IndexedDB
