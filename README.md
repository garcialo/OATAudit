# OAT Audit

Open Accessibility Testing (OAT) Audit is a web application that helps track manual accessibility audits.

## Can I use it?

There isn't a lot of functionality right now, but sure. The URL is below.

[OAT Audit (https://www.garcialo.com/OATAudit/)](https://www.garcialo.com/OATAudit/)

Keep in mind that while it's still in development, no efforts will be made to ensure compatibility with previous versions, so things will absolutely break. If you still want to use it, I'd suggest cloning the repo yourself and running it locally to avoid any changes.

The [OAT Audit repo Wiki](https://github.com/garcialo/OATAudit/wiki) is also being developed.

## Why?

Realizing there weren't any free open-source tools to track manual accessibility auditing, I created an [accessibility testing checklist (http://checklist.garcialo.com)](http://checklist.garcialo.com) as a first step towards creating a Google Sheets-based [auditing spreadsheet (http://audit.garcialo.com)](http://audit.garcialo.com) to help me track audits.

This project is intended to recreate and eventually improve upon the auditing spreadsheet.
